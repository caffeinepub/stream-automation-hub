  "summary": "The implementation comprehensively addresses all requirements for admin authentication and subscription management dashboard. Backend includes isOwner field in UserProfile with proper access control, owner status checking function, and full CRUD operations for subscription plans restricted to owner access. Frontend implements admin dashboard with subscription plan management UI, owner badge display in profile, and conditional admin navigation link. Migration properly handles the new isOwner field. All acceptance criteria appear to be met with appropriate evidence in the diff.",
