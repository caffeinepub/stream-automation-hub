  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all three requirements: REQ-35 (Stripe Connect button for owner), REQ-36 (light blue menu background), and REQ-37 (automatic owner badge for CelestiNix). The backend implements owner badge logic checking against the 'CelestiNix' username, the frontend adds a Stripe Connect button visible only to owners, and the menu background has been changed to light blue throughout the application.",
