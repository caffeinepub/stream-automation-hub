# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add Stripe Connect login for owner authentication, apply light blue menu styling, and implement automatic owner badge assignment for CelestiNix.

**Planned changes:**
- Add Stripe Connect login button in header visible only to owner (CelestiNix)
- Change menu background color from white to light blue
- Implement automatic owner badge assignment when CelestiNix logs in

**User-visible outcome:** The owner (CelestiNix) can access Stripe Connect to link subscriptions to their bank account via a button in the header, the menu displays a light blue background instead of white, and CelestiNix automatically receives an owner badge upon login.
